## Objective

The objective of this project is to build an interactive USA, Brazil and worldwide corona virus dashboard using the Dash library and setting it up in a remote server for anyone to see.


## Process
- Create virtual environment;
- Get the data from repositories and web sites;
- Data cleaning and transformation;
- Smooth the data via LOWESS method;
- Prediction modeling;
- Encapsulate into classes;
- Build dashboard with Dash;
- Deploy dashboard via Python Anywhere;


## Virtual Environment
******

## Getting the data
The data for USA and world can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" target='_blank'>John Hopkins COVID-19 GitHub repository. </a> While for Brazil the data is available in CSV format at <a href="https://covid.saude.gov.br/" target='_blank'>Ministry of Health website.</a> The data keeps track of all cases and deaths sorted by either country or state, therefor, containing all information needed for the project.

## Data cleaning
     
We named the bot as "Helo" and she was trained to understand questions asked in Portuguese:

## Learning Process

### Theory Applied
- [x] Numpy
- [x] Pytorch
- [x] Neural Nets
- [x] Flask

### Challenges
- Training the bot to understand the words was challenging, especially because Portuguese have some special characters like (^~`Â´).

### Improvements
 - The JSON file does not have much info, we could improve this in order to get better responses from the bot.
